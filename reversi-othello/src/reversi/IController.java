	 * Implement this to update any state information.
	 * This is really used to simplify your testing (so that SimpleTestModel will work for you) and to simplify my testing.
	 * 
	 * Ideally this needs to do three things:
	 * If the controller uses the finished flag, then it should look at the board and set the finished flag or not according to whether the game has finished.
	 * If the controller use the player number, then it should check it in case it changed. (Probably nothing to do for this.) 
	 * Also set the feedback to the user according to which player is the current player (model.getPlayer()) and whether the game has finished or not.
	 * 
	 * Once you have implemented this, you may find it easy to just call it after each time you add a piece to the board and have changed the player, to update the player feedback and the finished status accordingly. 
	 * e.g. mine for Reversi does the following
	 * If current player cannot play, change to other player.
	 * If this player also cannot play then end the game - count the number of pieces, set the labels for players, and set the finished flag.
	 * If the game has not finished, send the correct feedback messages to players to tell them whose turn it is.
